Recently in 2021, Governor Punjab decided that housing authorities, for example RDA, be replaced by the District Council to issue NOCs to housing societies (since there was a conflict of jurisdiction between the two). This effectively resulted BWC an approved society because BWC already had NOC from the District Council (and the management celebrated it widely on social media and on BWC site). But again, the Disctrict has to issue a fresh NOC for which now BWC has also applied for and it is highly hoped by the management that NOC approval will be announced soon.",
